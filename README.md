Hi there! :) 

This is the first project I upload to github, and in the moment I'm writing this, I'm new to both git and github. 

Rohde's Battleships Bot is a bot that can play Battleships. Check the GameRules.txt for information on how the bot works, and which version of battleships it plays :) 

Bye! :) 

PS: This is my newest project, and one I'm currently working on (December 2015). Planning to have it run on a server I'll code. And I will of course optimize, and fix errors.
