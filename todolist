# hvis et skib har ramt koordinat-J og misser, men saa rammer et koordinat ved siden af, vil den alligevel proeve at ramme J...

# arewehit fucntion  ELSEIF INPUT IS NOT COORDINATES TRY AGAIN

# if the enemy places it's ships besides eachother, the bot won't know what to do. If the bot has hit something more than once, and
then misses at both ends without sinking something, it has encountered two or more ships that lay beside each other.
Strategy: If misses twice, take currentShip and put it into another list. Search for each ship starting from each currentShip coordinate
 (make sure not to shoot anywhere that has already been shot)


Shoot random

Never shoot at same place twice

Shoot in a circle around 1'st hit until second hit. Continue to shoot in that direction, until either MISS or SUNK. If SUNK, shoot random.
If MISS, shoot at other end. If MISS again, two ships laying besides each other have been shot at. Shoot in circle around the HIT COORDINATES in
CURRENT SHIP, until another hit. Continue to shoot in the direction until either MISS or SUNK. If MISS, shoot at other end. If SUNK, shoot in circle
around the other HIT COORDINATES in CURRENT SHIP. Continue until you have sunk the amount that you hit in the start. :)

searchForDirection = 0
# 0 means that we haven't searched any directions yet. 1 means we've shot to the right. 2 means we've tried both the right and the top.
# 3 means we've tried botht the right, top and the left. 4 means we've shot at the bottom, and then all directions have been tried. Something is
# wrong then.

Circle, one direction, other direction (CODOD): (increases or gets reset to 1 depending on response from opponent.
0) 0 hits, shoot random
1) 1 hit, circle-shooting to locate rest of ship
2) 1+ hits, 0 misses after verOrHor has been found out: found direction of ship, shooting in the direction
3) 1+ hits, 1 misses after verOrHor has been found out: found one end of the ship, shooting in the opposite direction

When the bot has found out how to


When the bot has a hit, it stores that hit in "startPoints", "currentShip" and increases int "hits". It then starts shooting the "stages of attack"
from the hit in  If it finds out it's shooting at several ships, it stores all the "currentShip" hits in "startPoints". It takes the first
 coordinate from "startPoints" and puts it in the "currentShip" coordinatesthe "stages of attack" methods. Everytime it sinks a ship, it removes that coordinate from "startPoints" and
continues with the next startpoint, until "startPoints" is empty.

Bot checks if startpoints is empty. If it's empty, shoot random. If it's not empty, and currentShip is empty (currentShip get's emptied each time there's
a sunk), the first element of startpoints is copied to currentShip, and the bot starts shooting at the currentShip, until it get's a sunk, or two misses.
If it get's two misses, the bot transfers all the coordinates from currentShip into the startpoints, and then removes everything from currentShip.
It then start shooting with the stages of attack method based on currentShip coordinates. When a ship is sunk, currentShip is emptied and the first
element of startpoints is removed. The next element of startpoints (which is now the first) is copied to currentShip, and the bot shoots at the new
coordinate in currentShip. When a ship is sunk, the currentShip is cleared and the first element of startpoints is removed, and there's no more elements
in startpoints, then shoot random and search for new ship.


Attack:
Step 1) startpoints is empty, so shoot random
Step 2) startpoint is not empty, but currentShip is, so take first element of startpoint and put it into the currentShip. Now do the CODOD.
Step 3) startpoint is not empty, neither is currentShip. Do the CODOD.

Opponent answers:
sunk -> clear currentShip and remove first element of startpoint
miss -> if CODOD-1, increase searchForDirection
        if CODOD-2, increase CODOD to CODOD-3
        if CODOD-3, reset CODOD to CODOD-1, put all coordinates in currentShip to startpoints and clear currentShip.
hit -> if CODOD-1, increase CODOD to CODOD-2
