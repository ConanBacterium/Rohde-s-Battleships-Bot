# hvis et skib har ramt koordinat-J og misser, men saa rammer et koordinat ved siden af, vil den alligevel proeve at ramme J...

# arewehit fucntion  ELSEIF INPUT IS NOT COORDINATES TRY AGAIN

# if the enemy places it's ships besides eachother, the bot won't know what to do. If the bot has hit something more than once, and
then misses at both ends without sinking something, it has encountered two or more ships that lay beside each other.
Strategy: If misses twice, take currentShip and put it into another list. Search for each ship starting from each currentShip coordinate
 (make sure not to shoot anywhere that has already been shot)
